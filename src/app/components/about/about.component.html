    <p>
        I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering in 2023. Throughout my college years, I acquired knowledge in various programming languages and implemented them in my projects using diverse frameworks. Despite my familiarity with numerous languages and frameworks, I concentrated on .NET during my final year, and thus have used it in my most recent projects. Currently, I am employed as a full-stack .NET developer, creating comprehensive web applications. However, I remain receptive to learning and utilizing different technologies.
