                <p>
                    I am a software engineer specializing in full-stack Development, proficient in designing and building software from front-end to back-end. <br>
                    I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering in 2023. Throughout my college years, I
                    learned various programming languages and applied them in my projects using different
                    frameworks.<br><br>
                    Despite my familiarity with numerous languages and frameworks, I concentrated on .NET during my
                    final year,
                    and thus have used it in my most recent projects.<br><br> Currently, I work as a full-stack
                    .NET developer,
                    creating comprehensive web applications. However, I remain receptive to learning and using different
                    technologies.<br>
